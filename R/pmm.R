#' @description This function is used internally only but might help others 
#' to implement an efficient way of doing predictive mean matching on top 
#' of any prediction based missing value imputation. It works as follows:
#' For each predicted value of a vector \code{xtest}, the closest \code{k} 
#' predicted values of another vector \code{xtrain} are identified by 
#' k-nearest neighbour. Then, one of those neighbours is randomly picked 
#' and its corresponding observed value in \code{ytrain} is returned.
#' 
#' @param xtrain Vector with predicted values in the training data set.
#' @param xtest Vector with predicted values in the test data set.
#' @param ytrain Vector with observed response in the training data set.
#' @param k Number of nearest neighbours to choose from. Set \code{k = 0} if no predictive mean matching is to be done.
#' @param seed Integer random seed.
#'
#' @return Vector with predicted values in the test data set based on predictive mean matching.
